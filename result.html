          Life arose on Earth at around the same time as favourable conditions arose.

          A consensus has not been reached. Some advocate for a low value, 
          arguing that so far, only one species on Earth is known to have 
          reached a high level of intelligence. Others favour a high value.

          This value is also speculative. While we ourselves do not make many 
          deliberate attempts at broadcasting our presence, we nevertheless 
          would be considered communicative due to our radio leakage. Your

          Some have argued that highly advanced civilisations may be able to 
          overcome all threats to their survival, implying a large value. Others 
          suggest a much lower value, considering the typical lifespan of 
          civilisations on Earth. Your selection is <span id = "LLikelihood"></span>
